# 1.7 Combine the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients and pour the batter into the prepared pans.

### Summary of Background Research on Combining Dry and Wet Ingredients in Baking

#### 1. Key Concepts and Theories
- **Baking Chemistry**: Understanding the role of ingredients—such as flour (providing structure), sugar (sweetness and moisture), and eggs (binding and leavening)—is crucial. The Maillard reaction and caramelization are important processes that contribute to flavor and color during baking.
- **Emulsification**: This is the process of mixing two immiscible liquids (like oil and water), which is essential when combining wet ingredients. Emulsifiers, such as eggs or certain fats, help to create a stable mixture.

#### 2. Best Practices and Methodologies
- **Sifting Dry Ingredients**: Sifting flour, baking powder, and other dry ingredients helps eliminate lumps and ensures even distribution of leavening agents.
- **Mixing Techniques**: Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients rather than stirring vigorously to avoid overdeveloping gluten, which can lead to a tough texture.
- **Incorporation Order**: Wet ingredients should be mixed first (e.g., beating eggs with sugar, then adding milk and oil) before gradually adding the dry ingredients. This helps to achieve a uniform batter.
- **Panning**: Use pre-greased and floured pans or parchment paper to ensure easy release after baking. Fill pans only to two-thirds full to allow for rising.

#### 3. Potential Challenges or Obstacles
- **Overmixing**: This can lead to a dense or tough product. It’s important to mix just until combined.
- **Ingredient Temperature**: Ingredients at different temperatures (cold eggs vs. room temperature butter) can affect the batter's consistency and incorporation.
- **Batter Consistency**: Achieving the right batter consistency is critical. Too thick can lead to uneven baking, while too thin can affect structure.
- **Leavening Agent Activation**: Timing is essential for baking powder and baking soda. Once combined, the batter should be baked quickly to take advantage of the leavening properties.

#### 4. Resources or Tools
- **Mixing Bowls and Utensils**: Use a variety of sizes and types (whisk, spatula) for efficient mixing.
- **Kitchen Scale**: Accurate measurement of ingredients is key; weighing can lead to better consistency than volume measurements.
- **Pans**: Different types (metal, glass,
