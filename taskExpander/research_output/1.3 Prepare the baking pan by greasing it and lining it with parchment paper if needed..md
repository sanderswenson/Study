# 1.3 Prepare the baking pan by greasing it and lining it with parchment paper if needed.

### Background Research Summary: Preparing a Baking Pan

#### 1. Key Concepts and Theories
- **Greasing**: The process of applying a fat (such as butter, oil, or cooking spray) to the interior surfaces of a baking pan to prevent baked goods from sticking.
- **Lining with Parchment Paper**: Using parchment paper to cover the bottom (and sometimes sides) of the pan. This provides a non-stick surface and facilitates easy removal of baked goods.
- **Types of Pans**: Different baking pans (e.g., non-stick, glass, metal) may require different greasing and lining methods.

#### 2. Best Practices
- **Greasing**: Use solid fats (like butter or shortening) for a thicker coating or liquid oils for a lighter application. Ensure even coverage, especially in corners.
  - **Method**: Use a paper towel or pastry brush to apply grease evenly.
  
- **Lining with Parchment Paper**: Cut the parchment to fit the base of the pan. For better adherence, lightly grease the pan first, place the parchment, then grease again lightly on top of the parchment.
  - **Alternative**: Use pre-cut parchment rounds for convenience in cake pans.
  
- **Double Lining**: For particularly sticky batters (e.g., fruit cakes), consider using both greasing and lining for added assurance against sticking.

#### 3. Potential Challenges
- **Uneven Coating**: Insufficient greasing or improper lining can lead to sticking.
- **Parchment Paper Slipping**: When lining, it can shift if not secured properly.
- **Fat Choices**: Some fats can impart flavors that may not be desirable (e.g., olive oil in sweet baked goods).
- **Baking Temperatures**: Some parchment papers are not suitable for high-temperature baking, which can lead to burning or smoke.

#### 4. Resources and Tools
- **Tools**: 
  - Pastry brush or silicone brush for even greasing.
  - Scissors or a knife for cutting parchment paper.
  - Measuring spoons for precise amounts of grease.
  
- **Materials**: 
  - Various types of cooking spray (oil-based, butter-flavored).
  - Different grades of parchment paper, including non-stick versions.
  
- **Guides and References**: 
  - Cookbooks often include tips on pan preparation.
