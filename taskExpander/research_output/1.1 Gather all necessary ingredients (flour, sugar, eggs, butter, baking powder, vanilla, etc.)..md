# 1.1 Gather all necessary ingredients (flour, sugar, eggs, butter, baking powder, vanilla, etc.).

### Summary of Background Research on Gathering Ingredients for Baking

#### 1. Key Concepts and Theories
- **Ingredient Functionality**: Understanding the role of each ingredient is critical:
  - **Flour**: Provides structure; different types (all-purpose, cake flour) yield different textures.
  - **Sugar**: Adds sweetness and affects browning; also contributes to moisture retention.
  - **Eggs**: Act as a binding agent, adding moisture and richness; they also help with leavening.
  - **Butter**: Adds flavor and richness; can affect texture depending on whether it’s melted or creamed.
  - **Baking Powder**: A leavening agent that helps baked goods rise.
  - **Vanilla**: Enhances flavors; often used as a flavoring agent.

#### 2. Best Practices and Methodologies
- **Preparation**: Before gathering ingredients, ensure you have a clear recipe to understand required amounts.
- **Measurement**: Use precise measurements (weights are often more accurate than volume) to ensure consistency.
- **Quality of Ingredients**: Opt for fresh and high-quality ingredients to improve the final product.
- **Organization**: Gather all ingredients in one location (mise en place) for efficiency and to prevent forgetting any items.

#### 3. Potential Challenges or Obstacles
- **Ingredient Availability**: Some ingredients may not be readily available in all locations; substitutes may need to be identified.
- **Dietary Restrictions**: Consideration for allergies or dietary preferences (e.g., gluten-free, vegan) may necessitate alternative ingredients.
- **Storage Issues**: Ingredients should be stored correctly to maintain freshness (e.g., flour in a cool, dry place).
- **Measurement Errors**: Inaccurate measurements can lead to poor baking results; using a kitchen scale can mitigate this.

#### 4. Resources or Tools
- **Kitchen Scale**: For precise measurement of ingredients, especially dry ones.
- **Measuring Cups and Spoons**: Essential for volume measurements.
- **Recipe Books or Online Resources**: Access to various recipes can provide inspiration and instructions.
- **Ingredient Substitution Guides**: Useful for adapting recipes to dietary restrictions or ingredient availability.
- **Storage Containers**: Airtight containers for preserving ingredient freshness.

### Conclusion
Gathering ingredients for baking requires a clear understanding of their roles, careful measurement, and attention to quality. Being organized and aware of potential challenges can
