# 1 Bake a cake

### Background Research on Baking a Cake

#### 1. Key Concepts and Theories
- **Baking Chemistry**: Understanding the role of ingredients is crucial. Key components include:
  - **Flour**: Provides structure through gluten formation.
  - **Sugar**: Adds sweetness, affects texture, and helps with browning.
  - **Eggs**: Bind ingredients, add moisture, and contribute to leavening.
  - **Fats (Butter/Oil)**: Add moisture and richness, and contribute to tenderness.
  - **Leavening Agents (Baking Powder/Soda)**: Create air pockets for rise.
- **Temperature Control**: Ingredients should be at room temperature unless specified otherwise to ensure even mixing and proper rise.
- **Baking Techniques**: Mixing methods (creaming, folding) impact the final texture, while baking at the correct temperature is vital for even cooking.

#### 2. Best Practices and Methodologies
- **Pre-Baking Preparation**:
  - Gather and measure all ingredients before starting to avoid missteps.
  - Preheat the oven to the required temperature (typically 350°F/175°C).
- **Mixing**:
  - Use the creaming method for butter cakes: cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy, then add eggs one at a time.
  - Alternate adding dry and wet ingredients to prevent overmixing.
- **Baking**:
  - Use the right size pan to ensure even cooking (e.g., 9-inch round pans for standard cakes).
  - Check for doneness by inserting a toothpick; it should come out clean when done.
- **Cooling and Frosting**:
  - Allow cakes to cool in the pan for a short period before transferring to a wire rack.
  - Frost only when the cake is completely cool to prevent melting.

#### 3. Potential Challenges and Obstacles
- **Ingredient Substitutions**: Substituting ingredients (e.g., gluten-free flour) may require adjustments in quantities and techniques.
- **Overmixing**: Can lead to a dense cake due to excessive gluten formation.
- **Underbaking or Overbaking**: May lead to undesirable textures (raw centers or dry cakes).
- **Environmental Factors**: Humidity and altitude can impact baking times and ingredient behavior.

#### 4. Resources or Tools
- **Tools**:
  - Mixing bowls, measuring cups, and spoons.
