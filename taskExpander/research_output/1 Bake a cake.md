# 1 Bake a cake

### Background Research on Baking a Cake

#### 1. Key Concepts and Theories
- **Baking Chemistry**: Understanding the science behind baking is crucial. Key components include:
  - **Leavening Agents**: Ingredients like baking powder and baking soda create gas bubbles that help the cake rise.
  - **Emulsification**: Combining fats and liquids (e.g., butter and eggs) helps stabilize the batter.
  - **Maillard Reaction**: A chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that gives baked goods their brown color and distinct flavor.

- **Measurement Accuracy**: Precise measurements of ingredients are essential for the desired texture and flavor. Baking is often described as a science because the ratios and processes need to be followed closely.

#### 2. Best Practices or Methodologies
- **Preparation**:
  - **Read the Recipe**: Understand the steps and gather all ingredients beforehand.
  - **Preheat the Oven**: Ensures the cake bakes evenly.
  - **Prepare Bakeware**: Grease and flour pans or use parchment paper to prevent sticking.

- **Mixing Techniques**:
  - **Creaming Method**: Beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy before adding eggs. This incorporates air, aiding leavening.
  - **Dry and Wet Ingredients**: Mix dry ingredients separately and then combine with wet ingredients to ensure even distribution.

- **Baking**:
  - **Monitor Temperature**: Use an oven thermometer for accuracy.
  - **Check for Doneness**: Use a toothpick or skewer to test if the cake is baked through.

#### 3. Potential Challenges
- **Ingredient Substitutions**: Allergies or dietary restrictions may require replacements (e.g., gluten-free flour, egg substitutes), which could alter the final product.
- **Humidity and Altitude**: Baking in high humidity may require adjustments in flour or baking time, while high altitudes can affect rising.
- **Overmixing**: Too much mixing can lead to dense cakes, as it develops gluten in flour.

#### 4. Resources or Tools
- **Baking Tools**:
  - **Mixing Bowls**: Use various sizes for different stages of preparation.
  - **Measuring Cups and Spoons**: For accurate ingredient measurement.
  - **Electric Mixer**: Speeds up mixing processes, especially for creaming butter and sugar.

- **Oven Thermometer**: To
