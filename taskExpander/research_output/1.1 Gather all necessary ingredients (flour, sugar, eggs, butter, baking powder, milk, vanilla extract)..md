# 1.1 Gather all necessary ingredients (flour, sugar, eggs, butter, baking powder, milk, vanilla extract).

### Background Research Summary on Baking Ingredients Gathering

#### 1. Key Concepts and Theories
- **Baking Science**: Understanding the role of each ingredient is crucial. For example:
  - **Flour**: Provides structure due to gluten formation.
  - **Sugar**: Adds sweetness, affects texture, and contributes to browning through caramelization.
  - **Eggs**: Bind ingredients, add moisture, and aid in leavening.
  - **Butter**: Contributes to flavor and texture; the fat content affects the final product's richness.
  - **Baking Powder**: A leavening agent that produces carbon dioxide, causing dough or batter to rise.
  - **Milk**: Adds moisture, richness, and can affect the browning of baked goods.
  - **Vanilla Extract**: Enhances flavor and aroma.

#### 2. Best Practices and Methodologies
- **Ingredient Quality**: Use fresh and high-quality ingredients to ensure optimal flavor and texture.
- **Measuring Ingredients**: Use precise measurements (weight is often more accurate than volume) to ensure consistency in baking results.
- **Preparation**: Gather all ingredients before starting (mis en place) to streamline the baking process.
- **Sourcing**: Purchase from reputable suppliers or local markets to ensure ingredient freshness.

#### 3. Potential Challenges or Obstacles
- **Availability**: Seasonal or local shortages may affect the availability of certain ingredients.
- **Substitutions**: Not all ingredients can be easily substituted (e.g., using baking soda instead of baking powder requires adjustments).
- **Dietary Restrictions**: Considerations for allergies (e.g., gluten, dairy) may necessitate alternative ingredients, which can alter the baking process.
- **Ingredient Storage**: Improper storage can lead to spoilage or contamination, affecting the quality of the ingredients.

#### 4. Resources and Tools
- **Measuring Tools**: Digital kitchen scale, measuring cups, and spoons for accurate ingredient measurement.
- **Storage Containers**: Airtight containers to keep dry ingredients fresh and free from pests.
- **Recipe Books and Online Resources**: Access to reliable recipe sources for guidance on ingredient ratios and baking techniques.
- **Local Grocery Stores or Specialty Shops**: For convenient access to ingredients, especially for unique or specialty items like high-quality vanilla extract.

### Conclusion
Gathering baking ingredients requires an understanding of their roles, adherence to best practices in
