Xbox games all around the front door and like Christmas decorations all around. that area and he just walks in on a bike and I'm like oh shit I didn't expect anyone to walk in while I was attending the door for five seconds I walk right up to him and I hug him and I tell him I love you he's like what? I said I love you And then he starts crying That was cute And after that He like I like what do you need if you hungry And he like I need some boxes So I go to where the boxes usually are and it looks like... It looks like my family have been there recently and helped me clean. So there's no, well there's like three boxes. and a bunch of, like, Christmas stuff, I don't remember. As we're doing that, he tells me that he's one half of a, of like a, I don't even, I don't know what word for it. He's one half of a pair of people who, one is the distraction and the other one robs you. And he's like, oh yeah, but I'm alone today. And I'm like, oh? Oh. Okay.

 It's easier to say yes to something that you want to do than it is to say no to something that you want to do. It's easier to say no because you want to do something that you do want to do than it is to say no to something that you do want to do. Use this to your advantage. Find the heart. Where are you coming from? Where do you want to go? Use this to incorporate things that you already know are good for you. Where do you want to be? What would you spend your time doing if you have the option. Will sleeping make it worse? Use this to frame your decisions about what you are saying yes and no to and why On a similar note should Should is the worst word You say should and it laden with guilt. You say should, and you don't do it. You're ashamed of yourself for because you know that's what you should be doing. So let's turn that on its head. You already know what you should be doing. So stop trying. Just say no because you know deep down inside that's not what you want to be doing. Say yes to the things that you should do. And then don't beat yourself up if you can't. It's about changing the direction, not changing your entire person in one day.

 Judgment is the barrier to change. Judgment is based on what works, the tradition that gives you a foundation to judge off of. Judgment and tradition is what prevents you from following through with your should. Your should comes from the heart. It eats in your ear. I'm not doing this thing, and I know that I should be, because it's good for me, or whatever the thing is. Face it. Look at the should. Where is it coming from? Allow it to come forward. Don't judge it. don't think it's better or worse than anything because all your judgments come from the way that you already do something just let it be present with you

Judgment, allowance, follow through, foundation, present moment, non-judgmental, self-reflection, tradition, heart, barrier to change
