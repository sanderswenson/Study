Just opened Obsidian for the first time. Like the UI so far, plus native .md...
Handle git notes through obsidian, then just save them in the repo?
Quite a powerful tool, organization will be interesting.
	Is there additional settings and configs that can be used to clean this up
	Dan Koe notes situation may be interesting
