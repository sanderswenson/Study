 Advertising on porn sites. General idea of there's more to it. Have you ever thought there could be more? That kind of stuff. There are more to life than this. Ooh, that's a good one. Decision making load. Decisions become easy when you don't think about them because they're not decisions anymore. So how do you put decisions into substrates? You have values. You have intentions. You stop judging yourself for every little thing that you do. You watch yourself when you don't judge something. You track that back to where that non-judgment comes from, and it comes from values and beliefs, right? I'm about to go do the dishes. That's crazy. That's because I'm fucking tired, and I know that I'm not going to get a lot of creative work done, but I have something brewing. And it's going to sleep. L-tryptophan may be a sleep supplement for me from now on. Heart felt weird yesterday. This morning. I don't think I took my magnesium last night. Maybe it's time to start doing that again. Maybe we try that multivitamin from moreplatesmoredates.com Mr. Mandaric himself, the gorilla of the mind. and we'll see if that affects me positively. One day's sample size is not that great, but still, it's not nothing, right? If I feel better tomorrow, then I'll be more happy about it.
