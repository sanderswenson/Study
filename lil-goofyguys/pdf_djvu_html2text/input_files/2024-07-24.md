### Direction
Llama 3 paper
AI vs Skill/Labor Arb
In the time of the internet (and AI) we are teaching kids out of books through people who give 0 shits
	Positivity, mindfulness, openness, engagement, question oriented, high communication, sovereignty, pain transmutation, reflection
		Higher state of consciousness for all will still generate dissenters, but ideally from a more wholesome place.
		It will have to teach the teachers, too.
		This feels like AI alignment
	[[Where to get some data]]
Some dude is making $1k mmr with waifu generator
	'Save time doing tedious prompts'
	Learning to make websites now
Llama 8b, get running on PC or cloud compute - back up tuned weights on pc?
	Fog is slowly lifting, steps are made with some amount of intent and direction
Move fast and break things, ride in intuition and movement

### What did I do, What worked, What didn't. 
Do:
	8:30 - Calm 1 cap, Smooth 6 caps, Ghost Energy
	Salt dehydrated my lips so bad
	Direction filled out
	Collected Syllabi
	Thought about JMM, David Austin
	React/Website research begins
		Taxes? Dashboard for user info
			Site analytics sentry/google/clarity
		Small wins: [[Projects/Small Wins/2024-07-24|2024-07-24]]
		Rust is lower level, worth foray
	**Removing question marks is a superpower**
	Make an llc rq for collecting tips/subscriptions
	Overwhelmed by options, undirected by project I feel is attainable
	Just gonna do python backend and HTML and add as needed.
		npm, npx, Chocolaty, react, node.js, so much at once
	Walk and foods with Court!
		Went on Jane's route for like an hour, very very green. 
	Saw San Fran hacker house, want to be there man.
	Feeling quite disoriented by webdev zone
	Overcomplicated the task expander, now I have no idea how to use it.
	Windows PRO for VM, docker projects for dependency control
	Phoned it in and asked claude to do the entire thing. Now I have a working app that I don't understand very well.
		Some pieces make sense, its just new syntax with Node.js and a new framework to use
	App runs though, makes the API request and returns some things.
		Should say 'fuck it' more often lol
Did:
	Forayed into the massive world of WebDev. Quickly found my bearings were false.
	Remembered that northwest registered agent is easy
	Node.js isn't that complex.
	**"For tomorrow" suddenly said fuck it and did what I figured might work**
	Some dude is making $1k mmr with waifu generator
		'Save time doing tedious prompts'
		Learning to make websites now
	Move fast and break things, ride in intuition and movement
	Realized I want to be around people that I want to be around, earnestly
	Collect some background and potential tools/vague ideas of tools to build LLM symbiote
Didn't
	Salt in the morning ain't it, at least high potassium
	School doesn't enchant me right now, just feels like something I need to do.
	Got frustrated and stumped, went to get food and go on a walk
		Could pivot completely out next time, or perhaps MVP the task


Musings:
	Failures can take on so many forms, it feels like a failure as I email someone late.
	Worry of failure as I take the first step.
	I need to make some shots and miss them to practice making shots.
	Shots can take many forms as well, depends on the size of the context. I like to shrink my context to self and learning only so that I have very little chance of failures.
		Self - I only have my previous self to judge based on, at my own discretion.
		Learning - I only fail by not understanding, and I can warp the size of the task based on ability to succeed. 
		I want to expand to Others and Action.
	Others - passionate, smart people who are unafraid of being in the nebulous zone of understandings
		Obviously want to be around

	Llama 8b, get running on PC or cloud compute - back up tuned weights on pc?
		Fog is slowly lifting, steps are made with some amount of intent and direction


### "For Tomorrow:
Get the website further along
	Strip the task expander for a single task to be elaborated upon
Virtual environment level 2, encapsulate all the dependencies in a single file" - 8pm today


### Really for tomorrow:
- Further familiarize yourself with Node.js and React frameworks.
- Experiment with npm, npx, and Chocolaty for package management.
- Integrate site analytics using Sentry, Google Analytics, or Microsoft Clarity.
- Virtual Environment to encapsulate all dependencies/better dependency control
- **Llama 8b Setup:**
	- Start the process of setting up Llama 8b on your PC or explore cloud compute options.
	- Ensure you have a backup of the tuned weights on your PC.
- **Engagement and Community:**
	- Reach out to people you find inspiring and want to be around (e.g., Kerry, Cory).
	- Consider exploring communities like hacker houses for inspiration and networking.
- **Personal Well-being:**
	- Maintain a positive mindset, practice mindfulness, and stay engaged with your tasks.
	- Take breaks, go for walks, and enjoy meals to prevent burnout.
