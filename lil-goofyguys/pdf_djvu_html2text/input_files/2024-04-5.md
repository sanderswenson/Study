 I had several dreams. First one I was running from a buffalo. I was just to see what would happen. I had a pole in my hand. Like a javelin or something. Ah, the buffalo was mad. I didn't really know the outcome. You were keeping pace with me the whole time. And I kind of faded away when I got to the fence. I had a dream where I was driving a car. I'm chasing somebody, I'm trying to chase, it's like a race. They talking shit back and forth and I was like oh man this thing always a traitor But I just gotta force it on yeah that kind of stuff And eventually I took off to the side of the road, and I also took off to a side road. I just started driving fast. For some reason, I was able to replace parts while driving it instantly. So that was cool. Makes me think a lot about those old business things. I had a dream I was in San Francisco Everything was a maze of activity A maze of buildings and walls and I was attending a party I believe it was Benji... If Benji were Asian... Oh, it was the... It was the girl who was wearing her roommate's pants and the cherry robe. Kind of a very square, proportioned face. Straight across bangs, curly hair, kind of. Her and her friends. and I kept asking where things were and how to get places and where's my car and how do I put my bag away and she guided me around at some point we were trying to pull off a heist or something Wouldn mark a name that funny And so we Had our getaway car and all that stuff It was like Felt like low stakes kind of thing food. Like bags of chips or something. Apparently weed. Maybe. I got what we came for. We loaded up my car and the big car that Mark was driving. I assume the girls piled in at some point. We drove out of there and we met at a place. Everything was still like, I don't want to say cyberpunk, but impacted. Houses built like right on top of each other. ...of each other, literally, even on the countryside. There's hills and grass, but there's four houses in one little spot. And so we pull up to one of these houses where there's a little gathering already. And I need to take a shit, so I sit on the toilet. That happens to be in the middle of the living room. there's one wall that kind of separates half of the room at the end of that wall there's the toilet I'm sitting on the toilet getting ready to do my thing and then all of a sudden cops everywhere cops everywhere looking for something I am aware that there is weed. They start making innuendos about whether you guys get trees delivered And we were all like what are you talking about He like you know cookies And we're all like, I don't, what do you mean? And they're really, they're thinking, they're looking around and it seems like they don't find anything. start to leave one after the other and we all get up to go and uh I think this is the beginning of the the racing thing the car that I'm getting new pieces for it's going just a little bit faster this thing's a fucking jello lobby bro it's so that's so bad but it was fun it was so fun driving around racing against somebody who's got a jalopy too you know so yeah my dreams

 I just wanted to put down the notion of businesses as a toolbox. Businesses are toolboxes. Businesses are tools. Businesses are tools. Businesses are tools to work towards the philosophical end. The alignment of my person dictates the alignment of the business, not the other way around, which is why I was caring so much about why am I making money. Because it's the thing that I'm compassionate about here. Money is the tool, but I know that I need a lot of the tool in order to make a big enough positive impact that I feel satisfied. I don't know where that's coming from, but I know that that's also an interest. I like to make the money because it's interesting, but I want to have a philosophy to follow around that.

 I need a product, I need something with a price tag on it in order to find out if the market even wants it. I need to iterate on it to see if the packaging is incorrect or if the idea is incorrect. I don't know how long I need to bash my head against a wall, but maybe it's not as long as I think. Maybe I'll just post this thing, I post a school community, and then have response. And right away I can ask the person who bought the thing, like, what's your favorite part? What's your least favorite part? What's the struggle that you're currently doing? You know, what's your struggle? Like that kind of shit I can find out like immediately from somebody on the community. I'd be so, that'd be so cool. That'd be so good, honestly.
