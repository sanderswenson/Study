 I had a dream last night where I was lifting weights in the 40s. I picked up the 40s and they were easy. They were just like, I was playing with them. I was curling them for fun. It was crazy, yeah. And then I went to be like, oh yeah, let's try to do some triceps. And then I started doing some standing tricep presses and my left elbow, it just is unstable. my left elbow keeps trailing to the left I should have realized that I was in a dream though because the the 20s morphed from 20s to four plates four or five pound plates or yeah four or five pound plates on one side and I guess no 10 pound yeah four 10 pound plates on one side and then four two and a half so the and I was like wait a second these were the 40s I was currently was it come on don't do this to me that would have felt so weird I would have noticed you know I didn't I didn't realize I was dreaming that was funny mm-hmm Ah, understanding. I love to understand in order to convince myself of action. I think a lot, and I tend to think that it makes me analysis-paralysized all the time, but it helps a lot to think my way through something, because then I can take a measured step, and then when things change, I can at least understand where on the spectrum it's changing, that kind of thing.

 If you find yourself giving advice to other people, you're probably the one who needs to hear it the most. But now I'm using my guide for sleep for me to spread it to other people.
