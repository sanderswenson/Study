# Copying people is ok

Direction:
	LLM - Coder, Teacher, Symbiote, LaTeX writer, Docusign Replacer, Crypto Trader (tech), Mentor, Jr Dev, More
	Money?
	[[We have school at home]]
### What did I do, What worked, What didn't. 
Do:
	8:15 - Calm 1 cap, Smooth 7 caps, Ghost Energy
	8:15-8:45 Wrote a xeet
	Began note, directional outline for the day, bookmarks on X for good ai
	Hour of bookmark reflections, collected some very interesting ideas
		[[AI Tools]]
		Homeschooling curriculum machine
			Format? Highly palatable for BOTH parents (maybe teachers) and students
				Internet palatability is insanely high
				Cognitive Ergonomics
			Constructivist Education, questions are gold
	10:30 Shower
	11 - vibrating and heart jumps... drank ghost too fast? Took till 12 the last 3 days.
		Eating after shower
	11:45 spent on X for some reason.
	Starting Eureka AI
	Many conversations with Court and Benji about AIducation ... people don't like "AI"
	12 - **High school equivalence requirements is about a 45% on an easy ass test...**
		**Read this passage, what are the themes**
		**I could literally teach an 8 year old how to pass this test bro...**
	2 - Use the fear of death to avoid depressant outcomes?
		Couldn't approach dying in mandala because I fear losing that fear?
	Aiming at changing the minds of a few thousand people. <0.00000001% of the population of earth
	Eureka AI does a lot of the heavy lifting as far as course generation... Model out the broad learning goals of HS, generate blocks of mini goals, sensationalize learning
	3:30 - setting up cuda and other drivers for transformer library
	4:30 - RAVE I NCOMPUTER? 
		BUY UPS NOW
	5 - Got CUDA working with pytorch!
	6 - "we love incremental progress" - sphaerophoria
	7:30 - doing dumbass ego lifting and hurt my fucking back on rows
	8 - food, winding down and musing about IDEs
	9 - Push study to github... green squares kind fun
	9:30 - installed Sublime text

### Did work:
AI tools collection
	Eureka kinda works? $2 aint bad
	Got CUDA working during course, computer lived
Bookmark reflections
Thinking about Homeschooling, talking with Court and Benji opened eyes to problems
	lots of notes [[We have school at home]] 
Learnt alot
Incremental progress, make debugging catches fun. Console.log lmao
Forming outlines for making homeschooling school
Importance of front facing/engagement
	Mr. Beast school?

### Didn't work:
Felt like I spun my wheels every other hour...
Stuck on CUDA for a while, but got it running finally
Egolifting is dumb as fuck

Musings:
	There are so many tools, we know this
	Wonder what I repeatedly think... this is a problem for AI later lmao
	Work is discouraging lmao
		It won't be perfect... I need reps to get closer though
	Learning in a vacuum is disconnecting from reality it seems, though the internet is a reality
	Teach myself Spanish with brainrot???????????
	So incredibly locked in rn, weekends all to myself makes things very important to work while I can - life to do things while I can
	**AI as a self tooling tool, the further you look into it the further it stares back. Prompt engineering LLM for LLM prompting to make better prompts**
		**This speaks to making C levels AI as well???? Prompt for vision culture generation...**
		I need to structure my weeks if Im gonna lock in like this... need a designated off day? 
		Need workout times/days, food scheduling and so on
	Mem layer for my LLM
	Time is moving quickly
	So little time, so much to do, learn, see
	Really feels like shoving all the water on earth through a single garden hose trying to use AI effectively/all this tooling and leverage
	AI explodes in leverages, in itself multiple times over
		Developing a 'seed phrase' to begin the processes of cascading progress
		Using AI to develop and tune it
	Learning opens eyes to the tools available... and the problems apparent
	Use the fear of death to avoid depressant outcomes?
		Couldn't approach dying in mandala because I fear losing that fear?
	Spent a ton of energy communicating about education as a system and the problems it seems to generate
		Feeling bad about the overall idea now? Eureka ai has it already.. .its just not packaged for homeschooling yet
		Not a complete tool by any means 
	Thought I knew something for a second there, talking with Court and Benji reminds me of the breadth of reality and experience.
	Data collection, adsense for topics?

Code Thoughts:
	AI debugger helper
	How to run multiple scripts at the same time?
	AI assistant that tells me my schedule/reviews day plan with me
	Python almost as fast as C? As in certain instructions are passed down directly to C instructions so only one extra step for certain things? Adds up over multiple levels and thats still the ideal case
