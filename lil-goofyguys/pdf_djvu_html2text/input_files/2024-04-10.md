 I had a dream I was talking to Alex Farmuzzi in the... right next to the sandboxes in full winter. Looking up at the trees over the propane tank. Made a joke about us who was titled depression. Woke up still thinking about that Realized I've been kind of Autopiloting my way through things Thinking about having a kid And how I would teach him things And what to do if he protests When I tell him to do chores I want to teach him As much as I possibly can Because I know a thing or two One of the things I know is that words fall so short to things just being done. Just learning with your own hands. Practicing. And the two things just need to be done. I want to find my Lila I want to reorient about what I doing and why AI. I realize that I'm on autopilot not really aware because several times I've had notions to get up and record things during my dreams and I never really realized that I was in the middle of one And I also never recorded that thing Maybe that's also why I wake up all through the night right now Or maybe I should just stop dosing the whole time I'm a 4-bit Because these intermittent wakes are just fucking stupid Thank you.
