 Thinking about mortality and the relationship that everybody is mortal, so like, what is the point kind of situation? Eh, we'll all die, so why do we improve? Well, I suppose in the context of dying, improving your abilities is just as valuable as simply experiencing this moment. which leaves an interesting question about what the fuck do I, why would I need to do something? Why would I do anything that I'm not immediately passionate about? And orienting myself in a way that that thing also keeps me fed is interesting. I suppose I should consider just that axis, like whether or not my passion aligns with feeding myself or do I live in a world where I can make any passion be me Huh Is that healing Is that helping people recognize that death comes for us all and therefore we should fucking chill out Karen McKenna is the lovely thing about it, right? Don't worry. You don't know enough to worry. Hmm. Yeah. So, why worry? What does worry mean? Why wonder? Why bother? Why question? Kind of. Why worry? Why think that my conclusions are even wrong? How do I even prove them wrong? Ooh. Passion is just as powerful as tools ration. That's kind of hot. Rationality, passionality.
