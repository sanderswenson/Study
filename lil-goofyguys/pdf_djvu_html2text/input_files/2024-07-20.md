What did I do, What worked, What didn't.
	Do:
		9-9:30 am Ghost, Mg 50 mg, Calm 1 cap, Smooth 6 caps, Breakfast: pear + oatmeal + fixings
		Reflect on yesterday
		Started research into e ink devices - feels like a dead end, what do I want to do with my evenings that doesnt disrupt sleep?
			Read unrelated things! From paper books!
		Reading some papers on NN 
			https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring13/cos511/scribe_notes/0411.pdf COS 511: Theoretical Machine Learning Lecturer: Rob Schapire
			https://gwern.net/doc/ai/1966-ivakhnenko.pdf
			Instantly tired by 200 page paper.
		Learning, inactive
		Letter to congress PSCI 110 - sent at 1:10
			Actual first likes on twitter lmao
			Did final quiz for PSCI... thinking the whole time about how to actually learn things
		Watched video about a guy who 'smoked his last cigarette' and realized I feel like that guy - my life is me smoking cigs rn, I want to be something more
		Looking into DATA and MATH syllabi:
			Structure is nice, but slow and unfocused for what I feel I want to be doing
				Unsure exactly what that is now, need a reflection session on this
			Collecting textbooks
				Mostly just want to train an LLM on these now...
				Finding more textbooks? Like lots more
				Eureka.ai tho
			I love random unsecured .edu pdf pages
		Went to dinner and walk with Court, ~4-7
		Julius is fucking crazy - wrote a textbook extractor for LLM in 30 seconds
		Watching sphaerophoria code
			Incredible movements, text navigations, docs access for specific lines ez in terminal?
			Like watching a really good factorio player lmao
			Outline for video, useful for projects! [[_sphaerophoria Outline]]
			Tired immediate after starting watching... its 8:30 tho
				Alpha waves powerful for absolutely lazing about that's for sure - training myself to enjoy working? Sent email without really thinking lmao
		Reorganized Obsidian a bit, slightly more project oriented?
		PUT THE FCKIN NEURON WEIGHT MATRIX THING TOGETHER just didnt have dot product at the front of my mind but vector outputs of neurons make sense now!
	Did
		Eating didn't slow me down much
		Paper is still real, books are cool
		NN learning was interesting
		Completed PSCI 110
		Downloaded several interesting texts
		Julius is amazing
		Vector outputs of neurons!
			Needed to grind that a little more probably
	Didn't
		Feel like I did much today - decided to go on walk/dinner with Court
		Didn't reflect the night before, felt lost in morning and day was largely directionless
		Absorbed some info, didn't really put much into action - other than finding Julius
		Option paralysis again
		Textbooks are cool, but don't provide much as far as deliverables...
		Action produces information, useful information!

Reflections:
	Julius is very cool.
	Cracked coders are so much like good factorio/D3 players
	Reflect on goals/direction each night - aim at something
	

*There’s no intellectual vantage from which you can’t easily sight a zone of ignorance, and that’s where your eyes should be pointed, if you want to learn. If math class is easy, you’re doing it wrong.* - **Jordan Ellenberg**

Musings:
	AI affords incredible leverage, time to spend a bit of research on which built ones to use?
		And, for what?
		Just make the docusign killer...?
		Just make the crypto bot?
	"Workflow" - Process of taking some kind of output and processing it for various purposes
	Usability most important feature for client facing products
		Snappy simple does what it says it does
	Screenwatching LLM makes multiple choice quizzes literally 0 input, no thoughts
		Creativity focuses on certain areas - particularly LLM optimizations?
		MMLU is literally a basic benchmark for LLMs...
	Eigen optimizations of various levels of LLM spaces?
	Does the ability to ask good questions demonstrate knowledge of the field? YES!
		It exemplifies exactly what you don't know, where things don't quite connect yet
	Learning
		Story
		Hands On
		Teaching
		Questions
	Speaking LLM, RAG based on ExoSearch/spider augmented with text recognition
	College... modeling is cool, abstract is interesting and geometry is required for so many things, linear regression is fundamental
		Is there a way to opt out of actually doing the work? as in the middle of the class?
		Check syllabi and see if I can speak with profs about min requirements
		Latex ai with visual recognition.... probably a ChatGPT api request...


### Unifying Framework for Creative Education

**Constructivist Approach:**

- **Principle:** Knowledge is actively constructed by the learner, not passively received. Emphasize discovery, exploration, and active participation.
- **Methods:** Encourage learners to build their understanding through exploration, experimentation, and reflection. Facilitate learning environments that support inquiry and collaboration.
