 Listening to the lead book. Thinking about how to do it. Where do I start? Reaching out to my parents, maybe? I don't know. I don't know if they'll give me the kind of input I'm looking for. because dad seems suspicious of that whole idea. I don't have a degree. Very well could be a useful point of ethos. Yeah, at least I kind of can do something of value right here on this piece of paper. that I'm gonna do nothing with. Or proof is in the pudding type shit Do it for free Do it at the cost of testimonials That's a hot one. I like that. Helping people sleep. Just for their input. Man, that's good though. That's a good one. I like that a lot. Need to think about that one more. because seems like a good way to do it. Gives me some knowledge about what I'm actually selling as well. Do I do it through school? Do I try to develop an audience I suppose I start with the people I know. Is that just it? Do I even care about my audience right now? Or do I need to develop the ethos to generate an audience right now? Is the research worth it as well? Or is it more of like a This is how I did it Do I start with a written plan? Oh that was a good one Every flavor of media that I could possibly imagine Make it that also Chat CPT helps a lot to take audio to text Taking audio to video is much harder Slideshows that kind of situation I should look into that again Thank you.

 the free stuff that I could provide could be literally just mindfulness coaching, just the same, the things that I think about anyway. And the actual implementation could be the way that you, one would use that information for sleeping well, eating vegetables, reducing anxiety, all of the above. The secret is actually the total ubiquitous nature of mindfulness coaching, not actually the mindfulness itself. Do I trust people to not connect the dots? I don't think I care because the ones who do connect the dots aren't my customers anyway. They're not the people that I'm looking to help, are they?
